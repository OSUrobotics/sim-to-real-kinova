# Jupyter Notebook documentation

Assumes that you know how to run Jupyter Notebooks



`cleaning_experiment_data_fml.ipynb` - cleaning experiment data, and has code to make a timeseries based CSV that you can later analyze with the technique of your choice (pandas, microsoft excel)

`combine_and_analyze.ipynb` - some code written for the more recent state space analysis. has the more recent visualizations involving heatpatches (not implemented) and grasp regions

`compare_visualizations.ipynb` - some proto code I wrote while developing sim2real state space analysis. can ignore
`real_world_replay_buffer.ipynb` - some proto code I wrote while developing the live learning code to learn from IRL episodes. should be scriptified already
`rotation_noise_hell.ipynb` - some proto code I wrote while developing the live learning code. see https://gist.github.com/jimzers/fa997c034c53b59fd3121877a9dfaaa5
`testing_aruco.ipynb` - code for testing if we can read images of aruco markers. can ignore
`testing_generated_coordinate_information.ipynb` - code that generates coordinates and takes pictures of the first frame seen.
`testing_policy_notebook.ipynb` - testing code for sanity checking RL policy actions under recorded states from real world vs sim
`testing_simulator.ipynb` - some sandbox code to play around the with reset fn in the simulator openai gym stuff
`test_pid_controller.ipynb` - unfinished PID testing code
Untitled1.ipynb - obj size state space stuff
Untitled.ipynb - force field stuff
`visualizations.ipynb` - proto code for early experiment visualizations
